# data-cleaning-pandas


Overview

This aim of this project is to clean and format a dataset containing information about shark attacks, and use the data to produce visualizations that will either prove or disprove my hypotheses.
<br>

# Requirements/Libraries Used:
This code was written in Python/Jupyter Notebook, using the following libraries:
<br>
- Pandas
- matplotlib.pyplot
- Seaborn
<br>
 

# Hypotheses:
<br>

## 1- Shark attacks are mostly fatal
## 2- Most attacks are performed by white sharks
## 3- Australia is the country with the most shark attacks
## 4- Australian sharks are the deadliest

# 1- Shark attacks are mostly fatal
